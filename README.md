# Project Name
Book4All
# Project Description
Books4All is a well-known bookshop that is hiring web developers to update its eCommerce website. It is inviting developers to submit a sample of their work but in a creative way. They want the developers to create a website to showcase what they can do.
Create a website for a topic of your choice like a book club website. Create as many web pages as you can as a part of the website displaying different techniques you have learnt in web development. Some of the examples are image galleries, CSS shapes, forms, responsive web design, etc. Make sure to showcase some pages with products as the bookshop is looking to put its products online. Use modern HTML5 and CSS3.
